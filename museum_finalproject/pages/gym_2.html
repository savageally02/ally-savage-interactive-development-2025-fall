    <div class="poem-line">I am not chasing anything.
 I am simply here
</div>
    <div class="poem-line"> moving in sync with a number
 that feels like it understands me.
</div>
    <div class="poem-line">I think about tomorrow.
 Heavier breaths and heavier metal,
 weights waiting like a challenge
 that does not care how I feel.
</div>
    <div class="poem-line"> The calm pace of today will be replaced
 by the kind of effort
 that makes muscles argue
 and legs remember their limits.
</div>
    <div class="poem-line">Gravity stops feeling so heavy.</div>
    <div class="poem-line">But for now
 this beat holds me together.
</div>
<div class="poem-line">
 It asks for nothing more than motion,
 nothing more than showing up.
</div>
<div class="poem-line">For now
 this beat holds me together.
